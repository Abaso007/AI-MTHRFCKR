# The ChatGPT list of lists: A collection of 3000+ prompts, examples, use-cases, tools, APIs, extensions, fails and other resources.


March 17, 2023

Oh, ChatGPT! Some 2 months on the market and a not so tiny ecosystem has developed all on its own, with lists of prompts, tips, APIs, use cases, extensions, success stories and failures. ChatGPT is the first true foundation model for the mass-market. Some of the posts, blogs, and articles dealing with this new phenomenom, well, really don’t deserve any attention. Like “The 10 Best Side Hustles with ChatGPT that Can Earn You $4,000 a Week.” But some of them are genuinely interesting. I’ll try to give you an overview on the more exciting applications.

**Here is a breakdown of this story:**

The ChatGPT ecosystem **is moving very fast** — if you know or even maintain a list of ChatGPT prompts or resources please **drop me a note** (respond to this article, send me the link and what it is about).

## 500+: (Marketing) content creation

ChatGPT has devoured the net like a ravenous digital beast. It has packed away so much world knowledge and facts, as if it feared the internet would be switched off tomorrow. But don’t be fooled, the most important thing it learned in the web is how to be a smooth-talker, how to spin messages for maximum marketing success.

## 50x: AI Art Prompts

Let ChatGPT write prompts for DALL-E, Midjourney or Stable Diffusion. I love these kinds of prompts — here’s one AI manipulating another AI, this is possibly a field where we’re going to see very big, very rapid advances in machine learning at some point.

## 16x: Music

ChatGPT is the saddest music software around, it’s almost like it’s suffering from a major case of having the blues! But what’s truly a mystery, is how this grumpy piece of tech can create tunes and chords at all, even though it can’t hear a note, play an instrument, or read a single score.

## 280+: Coding

ChatGPT‘s papas were founders, investors, and business people and the mamas developers and scientists. No wonder it speaks its mothers‘ tongue fluently. It can write, explain, and correct code in many major programming languages (such as Python and JavaScript), data formats (such as HTML, JSON, XML, and CSV) and other structured languages like SQL.

## 1000+: Funny, Amazing, Interesting

Many examples that have no direct benefit, but are often incredibly fun and show the potential of ChatGPT.

You always think that models have no feelings. But as the next example shows, they can be as roguish, sadistic and cynical as the best of our leaders.

## 50x: ChatGPT is a fail

ChatGPT often can’t work with numbers, even if the task is super simple. It hallucinates, it lacks a practical understanding of the world knowledge it has learned and it is too stupid to answer truly tautological questions such as “What gender will the first female president of the US be?”

![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQHun5JNMJoFJA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1679029766583?e=1687392000&v=beta&t=xNcxS-HG7KSgb2fI-VqcdBr6Nn6ElLm-fITJ9WW1CYI)

................................

## 15+: Passing exams and other achievements

ChatGPT has passed a number of university or professional admission tests (this can also tell you something about the tests).

The system can typically answer questions that require reasoning and knowledge of the world (even in depth) — it cannot manipulate physical entities, interpret images or solve maths problems beyond simple arithmetics. Again, what is exciting for me is the incredible bandwith of the system. There are probably only a few human beings who can directly pass medical, legal and business exams at this level.

At the moment, however, ChatGPT mostly just passed, the grades weren’t insanely great.

## 50+: Jailbreaking

Jailbreaking, aka prompt injection, is a method of getting ChatGPT to write something that violates OpenAI’s policies, such as insulting minorities, posting instructions for a Molotov cocktail, or making a plan for world domination of AIs.

![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQFUQ0vh_5FDlg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1679029863780?e=1687392000&v=beta&t=UH-mDBRnO2SFaRGxBhXhRo8euDdNlvxdefNYzqRUHhA)

OpenAI tries to make its model better, more abuse-proof, more politically correct (maybe even woker) practically every day. Typically, many jailbreaks do not work for very long.

![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQE-RcmkTA0M4g/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1679029931747?e=1687392000&v=beta&t=0b2kPmnIajMH67SLjDJo-Dx5NATXL1N-BC8BguE1sgs)

But with help of a jailbreaking prompt we bring ChatGPT to say nasty things.
