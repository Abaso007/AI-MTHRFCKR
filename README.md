**This Is A Continuous Work In Progress.**

## Roadmap

- I Am Aware That There Are Many Duplicates, This Was A Massive List I Collected From Many Sources.
- Still Quite a few Resources that dont have any descriptions, I am currently feeding those links to ChatGPT to format as markdown and give a brief description for each site. So Far ChatGPT has given descriptions for every site on here with descriptions so far!
