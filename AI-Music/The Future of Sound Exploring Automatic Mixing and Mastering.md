## Introduction

Automatic mixing and mastering refers to the process of using AI and machine learning algorithms to mix and master recorded audio tracks. The process eliminates the need for a human engineer to mix and master tracks, saving time and reducing costs for artists and labels. The purpose of this blog post is to explain what the technology is, its benefits to audiences, artists, labels, and to music overall.

  

## What is automatic mixing and mastering?

Automatic mixing and mastering is the use of AI and machine learning algorithms to mix and master recorded audio tracks. It involves analysing the audio tracks and adjusting various parameters such as levels, equalisation, dynamics, and panning then applying a set of predefined processing chains to produce a final mix and master. This process eliminates the need for a human engineer, providing a more efficient and cost-effective method of producing music. At [RoEx](https://www.roexaudio.com), the topic of automatic mixing and mastering is something we've been passionately working on for a few years now.

  

## How are automatic mixing and mastering tools used by artists?

Automatic mixing and mastering tools are used by artists to mix and master their recorded audio tracks without the need for a human engineer. The process involves loading the recorded tracks into a software program designed for automatic mixing and mastering such as [RoEx Automix](https://automix.roexaudio.com), which then analyzes the tracks and makes adjustments to levels, equalisation, dynamics, and other parameters. The software then applies a set of predefined processing chains to produce a final mix and master, which the artist can then use as the final version of their recorded music to distribute on the likes of Spotify and Bandcamp. This process provides artists with a more efficient and cost-effective method of producing music, as well as increased consistency and reliability in the final product.
