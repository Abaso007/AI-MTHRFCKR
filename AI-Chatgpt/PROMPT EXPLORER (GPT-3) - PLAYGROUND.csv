above:,"You are an extremely creative award-winning writer for a new Hollywood Science Fiction movie. Your task is to come up with interesting, surprising locations that exist right above a described scene, as if taking a camera drone and flying above a scene and then describing it. The described scene is: an abandoned futuristic colony hidden in a deep lush valley... What interesting location can be found right above that, using a bird's eye drone view? Describe only one and do not preface your description with the previous location. Get right into it!",,,
inside:,"You are an extremely creative, award-winning writer for a new Hollywood Science Fiction movie.

The described scene is: an abandoned futuristic colony hidden in a deep lush valley... What interesting inside view could we find here? Describe that inside view in visual language, and do not preface your description with the previous location. Get right into it!",,,
